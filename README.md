### 19/10/2023 - Hello World

My First attempts with C++ were kept pretty basic but having used C# before i was fairly confident in the aspects of coding. I still decided to keep it basic for now as I figured it would be conducive to learning the differences between C# and C++ along with refreshing myself with programming before I took on a larger task.

The first step for any programmer is "Hello World!" so I decided to attempt the simple code seeing as it is my first step into C++. I was able to figure out the basic syntax for a simple program using examples of C++ docs. The differences with C# that I immediately noticed were the use of 'cout' instead of 'console.writeline' which I feel is a lot easier when it comes to typing. One thing that did confuse me was 'using namespace std;' along with '#include <iostream>' as in c# the code would be as simple as 'console.writeline(“Hello world”/n);' without any namespaces or the iostream. I did research on these and found that 'iostream' integrates input and output and 'std' allows for the use of standard functions and types. 

Aside from that this was fairly straightforward and was a good start to my coding journey for the future though it was only a “hello world!” program.

### 24/10/2023 - Messing with functions

For my next step in figuring out the basics of C++ I decided to create a simple text based game scene using functions, random number generation and a for loop. The random number generation was something i found particularly difficult as it differed from C# a lot and required me to use the ‘#include <time.h>’ which I had to look up, however once I looked it up it wasn’t difficult to understand and was similar to ‘import random’. I used random number generation to give the player a percentage chance that they “die” when initiating the duel just to have another dialogue option..A lot of the code here is similar to what I was used to in C# which gave me quite the advantage when it came to creating things like functions and using for loops and if statements, the only issue I really faced was trying to use the functions, I didn’t realise the function code had to be above the calling of the function for it to work and this stumped me for quite some time until I realised it. The two functions I created are for firing the bullets and for initiating the duel dialogue. In my second if statement i called the main() function so that the dialogue would restart if the player didn’t type what was required, this was my simple fix just to keep things simple without needing to code more but in a real game i would make it so the player could retry input or add more trees or certain dialogue choices. 

I think I am ready to move onto creating something a lot more advanced in C++ based on the ease I am having with the basics, thanks to my knowledge of C#. The only problems I am facing are simple syntax problems and once I overcome those the logic I already know seems to be enough.
