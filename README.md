C++ -
My First attempts with C++ were kept pretty basic but having used C# before i was fairly confident in the aspects of coding. I still decided to keep it basic for now as I figured it would be conducive to learning the differences between C# and C++ along with refreshing myself with programming before I took on a larger task.

19/10/2023 - Hello World


The first step for any programmer is “Hello World!” so I decided to attempt the simple code seeing as it is my first step into C++. I was able to figure out the basic syntax for a simple program using examples of C++ docs. The differences with C# that I immediately noticed were the use of “cout” instead of “console.writeline” which I feel is a lot easier when it comes to typing. One thing that did confuse me was “using namespace std;” along with “include <iostream>” as in c# the code would be as simple as “console.writeline(“Hello world”/n);” without any namespaces or the iostream. I did research on these and found that iostream integrates input and output and std allows for the use of standard functions and types. 

Aside from that this was fairly straightforward and was a good start to my coding journey for the future though it was only a “hello world!” program.
